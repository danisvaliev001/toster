this is toster, aka time coster, github-based way to record hours worked and calculate final costs 👹

⚽ works on GitHub Actions
🤸🏻‍♂️ based on CUE
🦍 installation/deployment is not required
👹 git versioning is part of logic

== quick start
. use current template and create a new private repo
. adapt `data.cue` for your needs – replace names and add new ones, change defaults
. commit changes with commit message like `add 1h30m to PeterWon`
. look up GitHub Actions Run, find a step with `👹` in the name, and look at the output to get your results
. rename `README.adoc` (current file) to `README.adoc.bckp` to simplify UX
