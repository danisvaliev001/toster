this is toster, aka time coster, an easy github-based way to record hours worked and calculate final costs

‚öΩ works using GitHub Actions
ü¶ç installation/deployment is not required
üëπ git versioning is part of logic

== quick start
. use current template and create a new private repo
. adapt `data.cue` for your needs ‚Äì replace names and add new ones
. (optional) change defaults in policy.cue (default values started with `*`)
. commit changes with commit message like `add 1h30m`
. look up GitHub Actions, view the `FINAL COST` step output to get your results
. rename `README.adoc` (current file) to `README.adoc.bckp` to simplify UX
