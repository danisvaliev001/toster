toster (aka time coster) – simple way to record hours worked and calculate final cost

🏀 works with GitHub Actions
🦍 installation/deployment is not required
👹 git versioning is part of logic

== how to
. use current template and create a new private repo
. adapt `data.cue` for your needs – replace names and add new ones
. (optional) change defaults in policy.cue (default values started with `*`)
. commit changes with commit message like `add 1h30m`
. look up GitHub Actions, view the `FINAL COST` step output to get your results
